      <h3>Grow 313's Vision</h3>
      <p>My passion is helping small business owners re-define the phrase 'small business' by incorporating mainstream technology services aimed at increasing the flow of traffic into your business.  Let's discuss where you would like to see your business in the next six months, how about the next three to five years?  Togther, we can generate a managable, customized plan aimed at streamlining how current customers do business with you, and how future customers can find you. Let's explore products and services which can reduce your overhead, and ways to include your business in a network of small business owners vested in Detroit's growth.  When community business owners partner with each other positive things begin to happen.  I understand the impact small business has on the economy.  Generating nearly 50 percent of our gross domestic product, small business owners have shaped the way the world does business.</p>
      <p>Aside from contributing to our economy, small business contibutes to growth and vitality in specific areas of economic and socioeconomic development by creating jobs, sparking innovation, and providing opportunities to achieve finanical success and independence.</p>
      <p>My goal is to bring the same 'big-business' technology structure to independent retailers.  Use the contact form to tell me more about who you are and what you do; feel free to include a little bit about your vision for your business in the next three to six months.  I will follow-up, within three business days, to schedule a consultation (don't worry, it will only cost an hour of your time) at your place of business to discuss what Grow 313 can do for your business.</p>
